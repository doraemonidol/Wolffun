The solution is putting in `solution.txt`.

In `process.cpp`, I solve the statement. Here's to prevent hard-coding I use a random function to randomly turn left, right or go straight. This will make the code become soft-coding.
Furthermore, everytime we generate a map, it creates a new map without any pattern!

In order to check the solution, I also use a `checker.cpp` to check whether the road violates the given rules or not.
